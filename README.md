This collection of graded projects for the main analysis types module in Turing College. It consists of 3 parts:
1. **Retention, Cohorts & Churn**: a brief analysis of a weekly subscription dataset looking into the customer retention and loss after disaggregating them into weekly cohorts.
   An Excel file with BigQuery SQL code and analysis tables is provided.
2. **Funnel Analysis and A/B Testing**: the funnel analysis part looks into a customer database and conducts a brief analysis of the customer activity by countries and devices used.
   The A/B testing part studies the performance of a marketing campaign launched by the company. The Excel file with BigQuesry SQL codes for both analyses and R code for the A/B testing is provided.
3. **Customer Lifetime Value, Segmentation & Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analyses**: The task involved conducting the customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis by incorporating cohort analysis with Shopify's formula.
   The analysis addressed two key issues: including all website visitors, not just purchasers, and examining weekly revenue for cohorts with a 12-week limit. The process included creating charts for weekly revenue, cumulative sums, averages, and percentage growth.
   Additionally, it involved predicting future revenue for the next 12 weeks based on growth percentages. The final chart provided insights into CLV trends for various weekly cohorts, including non-purchasers, with attention to conditional formatting.
   The Excel file with BigQuery SQL codes and analysis tables is provided. Also, for the RFM analysis part a Tableau dashboard was created for better illustration: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrius.svilpauskas/viz/TCModule3Sprint3/Dashboard1
